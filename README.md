# FF14 Rotation Helper
This helpful webapp is designed to help practice rotations using a controller in FF14.

## Expected Features:
* Take a rotation (opener) and save
* Monitor user performing rotation with controller with configurable GCD timer
* Support for "weaving".

## Stretch Goals
* Display rotation with GCD timing data.
* Display cooldown animation.
* MP/TP checking?

## Super Nice-to-have but probably won't...
* Timing rotations to other party members' buffs
* Sound?
